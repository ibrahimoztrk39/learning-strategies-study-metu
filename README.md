# Learning Strategies and Study Behaviors among METU Students

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for **STAT 365** at the Department of Statistics, Middle East Technical University.  
The study investigates how academic success (cumulative GPA) is related to students’ learning strategies, study behaviors, study environments, and extracurricular activities.

Rather than focusing solely on the quantity of study time, the project emphasizes the role of **self-regulation, lecture attendance, adaptability, and engagement** in academic performance.

## Research Objectives
- To examine whether self-regulatory learning strategies (lecture attendance and regular topic review) are stronger predictors of academic success than weekly study hours.
- To analyze the relationship between study environment adaptability and academic performance.
- To investigate whether extracurricular activities (sports and social activities) compete with weekly study time.

## Data Description
- **Sample size:** 121 METU undergraduate students  
- **Data source:** Original survey data collected via face-to-face and online questionnaires  
- **Sampling method:** Convenience sampling with elements of snowball sampling  
- **Key variables:**
  - Cumulative GPA (cGPA)
  - Weekly study hours
  - Lecture attendance
  - Regular topic review
  - Study environment perceptions (dormitory, café)
  - Sports and social activity participation

Likert-scale items were treated as ordinal variables, and GPA categories were converted to approximate numeric midpoints where required.

## Methodology
The analysis combines descriptive and inferential statistical techniques:
- Descriptive statistics and frequency summaries
- Pearson and Spearman correlation analysis
- Multiple linear regression
- Regression diagnostics and interpretation
- Visualization through correlation heatmaps

All analyses focus on interpretation and statistical reasoning rather than causal claims.

## Key Findings
- **Lecture attendance** emerged as the strongest and only statistically significant predictor of GPA in the multiple regression model.
- **Weekly study hours** showed no significant relationship with academic success when controlling for learning strategies.
- Higher-GPA students demonstrated greater **adaptability to different study environments**, including cafés and dormitories.
- **Sports participation** showed a marginal negative association with weekly study time, while social activities did not significantly reduce study hours.

These results support the conclusion that the *quality of engagement* is more important than the *quantity of study time* for academic success at METU.

## Tools
- Statistical analysis and modeling
- Survey-based data analysis
- Academic reporting and interpretation

(Note: While statistical software was used during the analysis, this repository focuses on the final academic report.)

## Limitations
- Non-probability sampling limits generalizability
- Self-reported data may involve recall or response bias
- Cross-sectional design allows association analysis but not causal inference
